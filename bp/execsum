Biofuels present a number of advantages in social,
political, and environmental regards, including
decreased dependency on foreign oil, huge
increases in employment to support the new
infrastructure, and mitigation of pollutants
driving climate change. The Obama Administration
plans to produce 36 billion gallons of biofuels
annually by 2022, of which only 15 billion can
come from the current leading feedstock of
corn. With the limited availability of corn for
biofuel production, a next generation biofuel
feedstock must be developed.

Algae has shown promise at the lab level, having
the highest lipid concentration of any
feedstock. As a monoculture, it can further be
optimized through species selection and
bioengineering. This leads to significantly higher
land efficiency, which is central to the design of
Sora's algae farm bioreactor. This bioreactor's
novel design incorporates the controllability of
closed systems while reducing structural support
needs and concurrently increasing the effective
light penetration depth. Furthermore, by obtaining
the carbon used for growing algae from coal-fired
power plants and other factories, this system can
assist in sequestering carbon emissions.

There are several algae farms already in the
market. However they suffer from two main issues,
namely in the lack of scalability and the open
pond design. There are also a handful of smaller
operations producing algae for producing small
batches of biofuels. These companies are splitting
their efforts between growing algae and optimizing
the processing. Sora's aim is to specialize in
algae growth and potentially work with these
companies for comparative advantage, ultimately
feeding into the Obama Administration's
vision. Thus, competitors become a major
market once production increases are in demand. In
the meantime, Sora's algae production in its early
stages may feed into existing lucrative
industries, including pharmaceuticals and
nutritional supplements.
